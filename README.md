# VoluLite

This was a project for EPICS (Engineering Projects in Community Service) which came in 3rd place
While I did most of the coding a friend and teammate who wished to remain anonymous did help
the file that had his name on it was renamed (at his request) as to no longer include his name

Some really over engineered early proto types can be found under CPProjects/ArduinoProjects/DW (Decibel Watch) in my ProgrammingProjects repository
The later versions in this Repository were based on my friends code just cleaned up, though I did recode the entire thing using my friend's code for reference

The goal was a visual aid for someone who went deaf (meaning they learned to speak before going deaf) and wish to continue to speak but struggle to be heard or speak at an appropriate level.
My team's stakeholder had an issue where she would tend torwards the quiet side.
As the code stands it includes a normal volume level mode, and a presentation mode. 
The thresholds would likely need to be tweaked as the microphone we used would stick to around 512 out of (assumed) 1023

approximate component list (to maybe update with links at a later date):
arduino uno then nano (prototype then final product)
a 3d printed case which I don't have the files for
a switch with a load (read), ground, and power wire(s)
a microphone with (again) a load (read), ground, and power wire(s)
3 leds (probably best if different colors)
battery pack for the arduino (we used a lipo . . . lithium something)
screws

I was working on a borrowed computer which didn't have Git hence the dated Files
some of which accidentally got saved changes before being saved as a new file
